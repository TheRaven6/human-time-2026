✔ Zero dependencies  
✔ Past & future support  
✔ Smart context detection  
✔ Works everywhere (Node, Bun, Deno, Browser)

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install human-time-2026
````

---

## 🧠 Usage

```js
import humanTime from 'human-time-2026';

// --- Contextual Awareness ---
// If it's currently 10:00 AM...
console.log(humanTime(new Date().setHours(8, 0))); 
// Output: "this morning"

// If it's 3:00 AM...
console.log(humanTime(new Date().setHours(2, 0))); 
// Output: "late last night"

// --- Standard Relative Time ---
console.log(humanTime(Date.now() - 5000));        // "just now"
console.log(humanTime(Date.now() - 120000));      // "2m ago"

// --- Future Dates ---
console.log(humanTime(Date.now() + 86400000));   // "tomorrow"
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

* Automatically detects **past or future**
* Uses **natural language**, not robotic strings
* Smart day-based context:

  * morning / afternoon / evening
  * yesterday / tomorrow
* Falls back to **month/day** or **year** when needed

No configs. No setup. Just import & use.
